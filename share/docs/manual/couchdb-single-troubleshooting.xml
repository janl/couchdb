    <title>Error Messages</title>

    <para>
      The errors reported when CouchDB is unable to read a required file
      have been updated so that explicit information about the files and
      problem can now be identified from the error message. The errors
      report file permission access either when reading or writing to
      configuration and database files.
    </para>

    <para>
      The error is raised both through the log file and the error
      message returned through the API call as a JSON error message. For
      example, when setting configuration values:
    </para>

<programlisting>
shell&gt; <userinput>curl -H 'X-Couch-Persist: true' -X PUT http://couchdb:5984/_config/couchdb/delayed_commits -d '"false"'</userinput>
{"error":"file_permission_error","reason":"/etc/couchdb/local.ini"}
    </programlisting>

    <para>
      Errors will always be reported using the
      <literal>file_permission_error</literal> error type.
    </para>

    <para>
      During startup permissions errors on key files are also reported
      in the log with a descriptive error message and file location so
      that permissions can be fixed before restart.
    </para>
