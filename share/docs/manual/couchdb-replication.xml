    <para>
      A database where you
      <literal>PUT</literal>/<literal>POST</literal> documents to
      trigger replications and you <literal>DELETE</literal> to cancel
      ongoing replications. These documents have exactly the same
      content as the JSON objects we used to <literal>POST</literal> to
      <literal>_replicate</literal> (fields <literal>source</literal>,

    </para>

    <para>
      Replication documents can have a user defined
      <literal>_id</literal>. Design documents (and

      database are ignored.
    </para>

    <para>
      The default name of this database is

</programlisting>

      <para>
        Special fields set by the replicator start with the prefix

          <para>
            A Unix timestamp (number of seconds since 1 Jan 1970) that
            tells us when the current replication state (marked in
            <literal>_replication_state</literal>) was set.

        </listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
        When the replication finishes, it will update the
        <literal>_replication_state</literal> field (and
        <literal>_replication_state_time</literal>) with the value
        <literal>completed</literal>, so the document will look like:

</programlisting>

      <para>
        When an error happens during replication, the
        <literal>_replication_state</literal> field is set to
        <literal>error</literal> (and
        <literal>_replication_state</literal> gets updated of course).
      </para>

      <para>
        When you PUT/POST a document to the
        <literal>_replicator</literal> database, CouchDB will attempt to
        start the replication up to 10 times (configurable under
        <literal>[replicator]</literal>, parameter
        <literal>max_replication_retry_count</literal>). If it fails on
        the first attempt, it waits 5 seconds before doing a second
        attempt. If the second attempt fails, it waits 10 seconds before
        doing a third attempt. If the third attempt fails, it waits 20
        seconds before doing a fourth attempt (each attempt doubles the
        previous wait period). When an attempt fails, the Couch log will
        show you something like:
      </para>

<programlisting>
[error] [&lt;0.149.0&gt;] Error starting replication `67c1bb92010e7abe35d7d629635f18b6+create_target` (document `my_rep_2`): {db_not_found,&lt;&lt;"could not open http://myserver:5986/foo/"&gt;&gt;

      <note>
        <para>
          The <literal>_replication_state</literal> field is only set to
          <literal>error</literal> when all the attempts were
          unsuccessful.
        </para>
      </note>

      <para>
        There are only 3 possible values for the
        <literal>_replication_state</literal> field:
        <literal>triggered</literal>, <literal>completed</literal> and
        <literal>error</literal>. Continuous replications never get
        their state set to <literal>completed</literal>.
      </para>

    <section id="couchdb-single-replication-replicatordb-docsame">

      <title>Documents describing the same replication</title>

      <para>
        Lets suppose 2 documents are added to the
        <literal>_replicator</literal> database in the following order:
      </para>

<programlisting>
{
    "_id": "doc_A",
    "source":  "http://myserver.com:5984/foo",
    "target":  "bar"
}
</programlisting>

      <para>
        and
      </para>

<programlisting>
{
    "_id": "doc_B",
    "source":  "http://myserver.com:5984/foo",
    "target":  "bar"
}
</programlisting>

      <para>
        Both describe exactly the same replication (only their
        <literal>_ids</literal> differ). In this case document
        <literal>doc_A</literal> triggers the replication, getting
        updated by CouchDB with the fields
        <literal>_replication_state</literal>,
        <literal>_replication_state_time</literal> and
        <literal>_replication_id</literal>, just like it was described
        before. Document <literal>doc_B</literal> however, is only
        updated with one field, the <literal>_replication_id</literal>
        so it will look like this:
      </para>

<programlisting>
{
    "_id": "doc_B",
    "source":  "http://myserver.com:5984/foo",
    "target":  "bar",
    "_replication_id":  "c0ebe9256695ff083347cbf95f93e280"
}
</programlisting>

      <para>
        While document <literal>doc_A</literal> will look like this:
      </para>

<programlisting>
{
    "_id": "doc_A",
    "source":  "http://myserver.com:5984/foo",
    "target":  "bar",
    "_replication_id":  "c0ebe9256695ff083347cbf95f93e280",
    "_replication_state":  "triggered",
    "_replication_state_time":  1297974122
}
</programlisting>

      <para>
        Note that both document get exactly the same value for the
        <literal>_replication_id</literal> field. This way you can
        identify which documents refer to the same replication - you can
        for example define a view which maps replication IDs to document
        IDs.

        show you an entry like the following:

      <note>
        <para>
          You need to <literal>DELETE</literal> the document that
          triggered the replication. <literal>DELETE</literal>ing
          another document that describes the same replication but did
          not trigger it, will not cancel the replication.

    <section id="couchdb-single-replication-replicatordb-restart">

      <title>Server restart</title>

      <para>
        When CouchDB is restarted, it checks its
        <literal>_replicator</literal> database and restarts any
        replication that is described by a document that either has its
        <literal>_replication_state</literal> field set to
        <literal>triggered</literal> or it doesn't have yet the
        <literal>_replication_state</literal> field set.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>
          Continuous replications always have a
          <literal>_replication_state</literal> field with the value

      <para>
        Changing again the replicator database to

    <section id="couchdb-single-replication-replicatordb-delegations">

      <title>Delegations</title>

      <para>
        Replication documents can have a custom
        <literal>user_ctx</literal> property. This property defines the
        user context under which a replication runs. For the old way of
        triggering replications (POSTing to
        <literal>/_replicate/</literal>), this property was not needed
        (it didn't exist in fact) - this is because at the moment of
        triggering the replication it has information about the
        authenticated user. With the replicator database, since it's a
        regular database, the information about the authenticated user
        is only present at the moment the replication document is
        written to the database - the replicator database implementation
        is like a _changes feed consumer (with
        <literal>?include_docs=true</literal>) that reacts to what was
        written to the replicator database - in fact this feature could
        be implemented with an external script/program. This
        implementation detail implies that for non admin users, a
        <literal>user_ctx</literal> property, containing the user's name
        and a subset of his/her roles, must be defined in the
        replication document. This is ensured by the document update
        validation function present in the default design document of
        the replicator database. This validation function also ensure
        that a non admin user can set a user name property in the
        <literal>user_ctx</literal> property that doesn't match his/her
        own name (same principle applies for the roles).
      </para>

      <para>
        For admins, the <literal>user_ctx</literal> property is
        optional, and if it's missing it defaults to a user context with
        name null and an empty list of roles - this mean design
        documents will not be written to local targets. If writing
        design documents to local targets is desired, the a user context
        with the roles <literal>_admin</literal> must be set explicitly.
      </para>

      <para>
        Also, for admins the <literal>user_ctx</literal> property can be
        used to trigger a replication on behalf of another user. This is
        the user context that will be passed to local target database
        document validation functions.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>
          The <literal>user_ctx</literal> property only has effect for
          local endpoints.
        </para>
      </note>

      <para>
        Example delegated replication document:

<programlisting>
{
     "_id": "my_rep",
     "source":  "http://bserver.com:5984/foo",
     "target":  "bar",

     "user_ctx": {
          "name": "joe",
          "roles": ["erlanger", "researcher"]
     }
}
</programlisting>

      <para>
        As stated before, for admins the user_ctx property is optional,
        while for regular (non admin) users it's mandatory. When the
        roles property of <literal>user_ctx</literal> is missing, it
        defaults to the empty list <literal>[ ]</literal>.
